# Frontend Challenge

## About the test
- Implement a fully functional React app from the mockup. Approximate spacing,
responsiveness, colors etc. as closely as possible.
- Use the API of any free weather service to show weather in real time for three cities of
your choosing. (yahoo, openweathermap, theweathernetwork, etc).
- All weather should be represented by an icon or graphic as shown in the mockup. You
may choose to use any icon pack you like, such as Fontawesome.
- Deploy to a server that can be accessed over the internet. You can use any host of
your choosing such as AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku, Azure etc. Be sure to include the
url in your submission.

## Requirements
- The app is built with React
- The app is fully functional and all weather is retrieved in real time
- The app is properly deployed to a hosting service
- All UI elements respond appropriately to user actions
- Code is hosted in a public repository, like Github.com

## Bonus
-  Use of typescript
- Use of LESS in part or completely
- Use of React class components instead of functional components
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
